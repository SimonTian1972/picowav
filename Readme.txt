Pico.cpp is the solution to the requirement. (C++17 or higher compiler is needed) 
The main idea is to calculate the autocorrelation values (ACV) for different lags. 
The lag of the first peak in ACV after lag == 0 is regarded as the period of the highest amplitude wave in a file.

Main.py is the program for prototyping.
